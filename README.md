# Webfishing Ban List
With the rise in trolls going server to server. I made this list of IDs that I've personally banned due to various reasons listed below. If you wish to ban them then here's the steps.
# How to use
1. Download and install the [LobbyLifeguard](https://github.com/Vildravn/LobbyLifeguard/) mod for Webfishing
2. Download the [leatest release](https://github.com/puppygirlzone/webfishing-bans/releases/latest) and place `LobbyLifeguard.json` in the configs folder (Browse local files on steam, GDWeave/configs)
3. Load the game and know they will all be permabanned
And ya done! Easy as that.
