# Webfishing Ban List
With the rise in trolls going server to server. I made this list of IDs that I've personally banned due to various reasons listed below. If you wish to ban them then here's the steps.
# How to use
1. Download and install the [LobbyLifeguard](https://github.com/Vildravn/LobbyLifeguard/) mod for Webfishing
2. Download the [leatest release](https://github.com/puppygirlzone/webfishing-bans/releases/latest) and place `LobbyLifeguard.json` in the configs folder (Browse local files on steam, GDWeave/configs)
3. Load the game and know they will all be permabanned
And ya done! Easy as that.
# Contributing
## Getting someone added
If you're wanting someone added to the list. You can do either of the following:
- Make a pull request with your SteamID, reason for being added and any proof you're willing to provide
- Contact unmatchedlunacy on discord with your SteamID and go through the unban process that way
## Getting someone removed
If you're wanting to have someone removed from the list. You can do either of the following:
- Make a pull request with your SteamID, an apology and proof you're no longer associated with any offenders on the list. 
- Contact unmatchedlunacy on discord with your SteamID and go through the unban process that way
> [!WARNING]
> UnmatchedLunacy will not deal with trolls. Nor will I personally. If you're genuine and not trying to screw either of us around then you will be treated with respect and removed ASAP.

> I will no longer be accepting discord friend requests or DMs thanks to the members of Grincher's Fanclub going out of their way to either annoy me or plain argue with me.
# DISCLAIMER
Providing this list does not mean in any way that I condone any form of witch hunt, trolling or any action other than adding them to your ban list. The wall of shame is merely to see their profile pictures and names for easier finding.
## DO NOT HUNT THESE PEOPLE DOWN
Stooping down to their level makes us no better than them. We as a community don't want to become the very thing that plagues our lobbies. Stay fair, nice and just report them here. No need for anything more.
# Support me
I don't really need it but someone told me it's a good idea so screw it we ball.
