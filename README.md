# Webfishing Ban List
With the rise in trolls going server to server. I made this list of IDs that I've personally banned due to various reasons listed below. If you wish to ban them then here's the steps.
# How to use
1. Download and install the [LobbyLifeguard](https://github.com/Vildravn/LobbyLifeguard/) mod for Webfishing
2. Download the [leatest release](https://github.com/puppygirlzone/webfishing-bans/releases/latest) and place `LobbyLifeguard.json` in the configs folder (Browse local files on steam, GDWeave/configs)
3. Load the game and know they will all be permabanned
And ya done! Easy as that.
# Contributing
## Getting someone added
If you're wanting someone added to the list. You can do either of the following:
- Make a pull request or issue with your SteamID/Profile Link, reason for being added and any proof you're willing to provide
<!--- Contact `UnmatchedLunacy` on discord with the offender's SteamID/Profile Link and go through the ban process that way-->
- Contact either `puppygirl.zone` or `unmatchedlunacy` on discord to have them added.
## Getting someone removed
If you're wanting to have someone removed from the list. You can do either of the following:
- Make a pull request or issue with your SteamID/Profile Link, an apology and proof you're no longer associated with any offenders on the list. 
<!--- Contact `UnmatchedLunacy` on discord with your SteamID/Profile Link and go through the unban process that way-->
- Contact either `puppygirl.zone` or `unmatchedlunacy` on discord to have them added.
## Changes
> [!IMPORTANT]
> Due to the creation of the [Webfish Airlines Botting Service](https://i.imgur.com/cy7MQlv.png). Puppy has opened her friends list back up in order to help counter this. 
# FAQ
If you have any questions then please read [faq file](docs/faq.md) to see if your question is answered there.
# DISCLAIMER
Providing this list does not mean in any way that myself, contributors or collaborators condone any form of witch hunt, trolling or any action other than adding them to your ban list. The wall of shame is merely to see their profile pictures and names for easier finding.
## HUNTING THESE PEOPLE DOWN
Various members of this list have gone out of their way to create this crashing service in order to keep us from playing the game. I no longer care what you do. I no longer care about being nice.
# Support me
I don't really need it but someone told me it's a good idea so screw it we ball.
