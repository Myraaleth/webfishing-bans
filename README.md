# Webfishing Ban List
With the rise in trolls going server to server. I made this list of IDs that I've personally banned due to various reasons listed below. If you wish to ban them then here's the steps.
# How to use
1. Download and install the [LobbyLifeguard](https://github.com/Vildravn/LobbyLifeguard/) mod for Webfishing
2. Go into your mod settings
3. Add the SteamIDs from the list into the box for users.

And ya done! Easy as that.
# Helping out
If you have spotted people in the wild who have spammed slurs, been offensive or gone out of their way to make the lobby an unsafe space. Feel free to contact me on discord with their steamid/profile link and evidence of what they did.
# DISCLAIMER
Providing this list does not mean in any way that I condone any form of witch hunt, trolling or any action other than adding them to your ban list.
