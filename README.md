# Webfishing Ban List
With the rise in trolls going server to server. I made this list of IDs that I've personally banned due to various reasons listed below. If you wish to ban them then here's the steps.
# How to use
1. Download and install the [LobbyLifeguard](https://github.com/Vildravn/LobbyLifeguard/) mod for Webfishing
2. Download the [leatest release](https://github.com/puppygirlzone/webfishing-bans/releases/latest) and place `LobbyLifeguard.json` in the configs folder (Browse local files on steam, GDWeave/configs)
3. Load the game and know they will all be permabanned
And ya done! Easy as that.
# Contributing
## Getting someone added
If you're wanting someone added to the list. You can do either of the following:
- Make a pull request or issue with your SteamID/Profile Link, reason for being added and any proof you're willing to provide
- Contact `UnmatchedLunacy` on discord with the offender's SteamID/Profile Link and go through the ban process that way
## Getting someone removed
If you're wanting to have someone removed from the list. You can do either of the following:
- Make a pull request or issue with your SteamID/Profile Link, an apology and proof you're no longer associated with any offenders on the list. 
- Contact `UnmatchedLunacy` on discord with your SteamID/Profile Link and go through the unban process that way
> [!NOTE]
> UnmatchedLunacy does not own or run the banlist. They just handle ban and unban requests. PuppyGirl.Zone owns and runs the banlist but does not want to be contacted.
## Changes
> [!WARNING]
> Puppygirl will no longer be accepting discord friend requests or DMs thanks to the members of Grincher's Fanclub going out of their way to create arguments and troll.
# DISCLAIMER
Providing this list does not mean in any way that myself, contributors or collaborators condone any form of witch hunt, trolling or any action other than adding them to your ban list. The wall of shame is merely to see their profile pictures and names for easier finding.
## DO NOT HUNT THESE PEOPLE DOWN
Stooping down to their level makes us no better than them. We as a community don't want to become the very thing that plagues our lobbies. Stay fair, nice and just report them here. No need for anything more.
## FAQ
If you have any questions then please read [faq file](docs/faq.md) to see if your question is answered there.
