# Webfishing Ban List
With the rise in trolls going server to server. I made this list of IDs that I've personally banned due to various reasons listed below. If you wish to ban them then here's the steps.
# How to use
1. Download and install the [LobbyLifeguard](https://github.com/Vildravn/LobbyLifeguard/) mod for Webfishing
2. Download the [leatest release](https://github.com/puppygirlzone/webfishing-bans/releases/latest) and place `LobbyLifeguard.json` in the configs folder (Browse local files on steam, GDWeave/configs)
3. Load the game and know they will all be permabanned
And ya done! Easy as that.

## Getting someone removed

# DISCLAIMER
Providing this list does not mean in any way that I condone any form of witch hunt, trolling or any action other than adding them to your ban list. The wall of shame is merely to see their profile pictures and names for easier finding.
# DO NOT HUNT THESE PEOPLE DOWN
Stooping down to their level makes us no better than them. We as a community don't want to become the very thing that plagues our lobbies. Stay fair, nice and just report them here. No need for anything more.
