# Webfishing Ban List
With the rise in trolls going server to server. I made this list of IDs that I've personally banned due to various reasons listed below. If you wish to ban them then here's the steps.
# How to use
1. Download and install the [LobbyLifeguard](https://github.com/Vildravn/LobbyLifeguard/) mod for Webfishing
2. Download the [leatest release](https://github.com/puppygirlzone/webfishing-bans/releases/latest) and place `LobbyLifeguard.json` in the configs folder (Browse local files on steam, GDWeave/configs)
3. Load the game and know they will all be permabanned
And ya done! Easy as that.

<!--- Contact `UnmatchedLunacy` on discord with the offender's SteamID/Profile Link and go through the ban process that way-->
- Contact either `puppygirl.zone` or `unmatchedlunacy` on discord to have them added.
## Getting someone removed
If you're wanting to have someone removed from the list. You can do either of the following:
- Make a pull request or issue with your SteamID/Profile Link, an apology and proof you're no longer associated with any offenders on the list. 
<!--- Contact `UnmatchedLunacy` on discord with your SteamID/Profile Link and go through the unban process that way-->
- Contact either `puppygirl.zone` or `unmatchedlunacy` on discord to have them added.
## Changes
> [!IMPORTANT]
> Due to the creation of the [Webfish Airlines Botting Service](https://i.imgur.com/cy7MQlv.png). Puppy has opened her friends list back up in order to help counter this.
