# Frequently Asked Questions
This is a small list of questions I've been asked about the banlist and just want to clear up.
## How often is this list updated?
Depending on how many reports we get in a day. It can be anywhere from multiple times a day to going 2-3 days before getting updates.
## Why was this list made?
Originally this list was made and shared with a few people so they wouldn't have to worry about users who acted maliciously joining and creating an unsafe space for people. The list was shared a few times before I noticed that the community was just as sick as I was with dealing with these users. So I made the list public and allowed others to share the same safety I enjoyed thanks to it.
## Why is there a wall of shame?
The wall of shame is not as the name entirely implies. It's a visual aid that allows maintainers of this list to find a person based on profile picture or profile name in order to remove innocent users or add malicious actors. As someone with a disability myself. This visual aid has came in handy more times than I could count.
## What's your motives?
Nothing more than protecting the community I play in. Others may say that I'm inciting hatred or uninclusiveness but that implies I harbor such feelings for people.
# Frequent things said about myself or the list
Things that people have said about me or the list to discredit me.
## SteamIDs are private and shouldn't be shared!
Many people come to me stating this as if I had to jump through 1000 hoops in order to get their SteamID. In reality, SteamIDs are often accessable by just visiting a user's steam profile. If they have a custom link then you just put that link into [1 of many websites](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=SteamID+lookup&ia=web) that will give you their SteamID. By no means is this information private or unaccessable by the public. You can even look mine up.
## Your list promotes harrassment of people!
While many have said this believing I made this list with the sole intention of causing these people harm. That couldn't be further from the truth. This list was made to prevent malicious actors from joining lobbies and causing havoc to people who just want to fish.
## Your list promotes excluding others!
A good portion of this list would of faced exclusion by their own actions regardless of this list or not. People have already mentioned some of the people in this list a bunch of times.

### THOSE POSTS AREN'T EVIDENCE!!!!
They're not blatant evidence correct but there's enough out there if you spend your own time searching to come to the same conclusion I have that people like this won't be welcomed.
## Your list is unfair! I got caught in a blanket ban!
Unfortunately people got caught in it. Innocent users. Just go back to the [main page](README.md) and follow the steps to be removed. Simple.
## Why ban an entire group of people?
Many people have sat here and tried to argue my reasoning but to put it swiftly and bluntly. We decided that adding the entire group and filtering out people via unban requests was a safer precaution than adding to the list one by one over time. This was mainly to prevent any form of **mass raid** or trolling if said group were to ever come together and form a bigger attempt.
## You shouldn't dictate who gets banned!
Sadly enough I shouldn't be the one who has to make this list. I wish this list didn't have good reasoning for existing. I don't blindly add people to this list. I make sure to gather evidence, reach out if need be and do my own investigation to conclude whether someone should be added.
# This should about cover it
If anything comes up then I'll be sure to add to this file.
